    <h1>Lets Read About JavaScript</h1>
    <img src="images.png" alt="JS Image" srcset="">
    <p>If you’ve been involved in front end development over the past few years, you know that there’s more than enough
        to give someone ‘analysis paralysis’. New frameworks and libraries are popping up every so often. Companies all
        over the world are facing the daunting task of choosing the right stack for their digital implementation. That’s
        a big challenge, in addition to working hard to keep up with the latest trends at the same time.</p>
    <img src="p1.png" alt="image not found">
    <p>Even for some devoted front end developers, there comes a time when tech stack becomes a personal choice. This
        can take precedence over the tech selection being the right or wrong method to solve the problems.</p>
    <h1 id="jsbap">JavaScript Background & Prevalence</h1>
    <p>Since its inception in 1995, JavaScript has been growing into the most popular, dominant language of the web.
        Over the last decade, the adoption of JS has only been growing, showing no signs of slowing down.
        According to StackOverflow’s annual survey, 69.8% of respondents and 71.5% of professional developers are using
        JavaScript today. With the prevalence of more web-enabled devices, the race to come up with the best ‘one size
        fits all solution’ grows bigger. This is great news for developers who either know JS or are planning to learn
        it. For those that are far from the front end world, suggestions are for them to try and gain (even basic)
        experience with it. This quote sums it up perfectly:</p>
    <div>“This [JavaScript] is perhaps the hottest skill developers need to up-skill in for the foreseeable future”

    <h1 id="AIh1">How will AI transform Front End Development — Far (or maybe not) into the Future</h1>
    <img src="0_p2.jpg" alt="Error in Loading picture">
    <p>Beyond libraries and frameworks, how will AI and machine learning shape the future of front end development? It’s
        a question asked by many, but a few companies are already leading the charge. They’re using different techniques
        in hopes of disrupting a field that has gone through different cycles of frameworks and libraries. The
        approaches are divided into two.</p>
    <p>One side aims at assisting developers by generating starting code from wireframes and sketch-files or generating
        an entire front end output. This helps developers focus on more important parts of development, such as
        application logic and building features. It speeds up the iteration of design phases and modifications. Those
        companies range from Airbnb who lately has built an AI that turns sketch files into raw code, to Uizard which
        uses a deep learning/ML (neural network) that they had trained to take a screenshot of graphic interface and
        translate it into lines of raw code. What’s impressive with Uizard is; a single textual to GUI renderer will
        work across multiple platforms such as iOS, Android and Web-based interfaces and the algorithm thus far works
        with a 77% accuracy.</p>
    <p>Then Microsoft’s Ink to Code app, who also took a stab at this and made their software available to download for
        free from the Windows Store. And finally, Supernova, which is a startup on a mission to accelerate the app
        development workflow of mobile designers and developers built a tool, The Supernova Studio macOS app, which
        promises to automatically convert mobile app designs created in Sketch, into native UI code, aiming to bridge
        the gap between prototyping and design, and front end development</p>
    <p>The other side took AI a step further and are getting machines to do the entire front end coding. BAYOU, which is
        a project that was funded by the military and Google out of Rice University, uses a deep learning tool that
        basically works like a search engine for coding. Through reading the source code of 1500 Android apps (~100
        million lines of Java), BAYOU’s neural net is now an AI that can program other software.</p>
    <h1 id="ct">Concluding Thoughts</h1>
    <p>The world of front end that we understand today is being dominated by three big frameworks; React, Vue and
        Angular (with Vue as the most promising of the three). However, knowing the past life cycles of frameworks, it
        will come as no surprise if a brand new framework comes along that is faster, more performant, and solves
        problems that existing frameworks are currently struggling with.</p>
    <p>The future I envision however will be a hybrid of everything available today. Where one framework, which is
        defined as the easiest to adopt by developers and proposes a complete solution, uses complementary techniques
        such as web components, web assembly and AI, to create an end to end solution for developing applications.</p>

        The core parts of the application will be built using web components so that they are used and shared easily.
    </p>
    <p>AI will serve to speed up the development process, whether to provide starting code reducing boilerplate, or used
        to validate the quality of the code produced.

    <h1>What Is Spirituality?</h1>
    <img src="mw1920_internal-asset.png" alt="Spiritual Image" srcset="">
    <p>Spirituality is a broad concept with room for many perspectives. In general, it includes a sense of connection to
        something bigger than ourselves, and it typically involves a search for meaning in life. As such, it is a
        universal human experience—something that touches us all. People may describe a spiritual experience as sacred
        or transcendent or simply a deep sense of aliveness and interconnectedness.</p>

    <p>Some may find that their spiritual life is intricately linked to their association with a church, temple, mosque,
        or synagogue. Others may pray or find comfort in a personal relationship with God or a higher power. Still
        others seek meaning through their connections to nature or art. Like your sense of purpose, your personal
        definition of spirituality may change throughout your life, adapting to your own experiences and relationships.

    <h1 id="jsbap">Journey Of Spirituality</h1>
    <p>The spiritual journey involves first healing and affirming the ego so that positive
        states are experienced; with secure self-esteem, belief in self-worth and a capacity
        for love and generosity, a person becomes less constrained by ego defences. An
        opening of the heart is an essential aspect of true spirituality. In this regard one may
        question the spiritual nature of masochistic religious practices such as selfflagellation, which is based on a
        belief in the wickedness inherent in the body rather
        than on any real connection with, and therefore compassion for, the body. This
        illustrates the fact that religion does not always serve the progress of spiritual
        development but may get side-tracked into practices that create pride, feelings of
        superiority etc. or else lead to a person becoming bogged down in unworthiness,
        guilt and shame - all of which emotions are commonly suffered by psychiatric
        patients. In short, religion will be taken up by a person in a way that inevitably
        reflects their own level of development and maturity.</p>
    <div>“You do not need to know precisely what is happening, or exactly where it is all going. What you need is to
        recognize the possibilities and challenges offered by the present moment, and to embrace them with courage,
        faith and hope.”

    <h1 id="AIh1">Development in Spirituality</h1>
    <img src="images.jpg" alt="Error in Loading picture">
    <p>Spiritual development requires
        successive degrees of freedom based on the realisation that thoughts are not facts
        but simply transient mental phenomena, as indeed are our emotions. Increasing
        numbers of patients are discovering this through mindfulness-based cognitive
        therapy, which in bringing a person to the here-and-now creates the mental climate
        in which this deep spiritual insight can help relieve anxiety and depression.
        Neuroscientific research is showing that with the practice of mindfulness, the cortex
        of the brain literally grows, with an increase in grey matter and more gyrification.
        Could this be the next evolutionary step for humanity, with meditation opening the
        doorway to changes and developments that we currently term spiritual but which
        may in future be deemed normal, even basic?

    <h1>CONCLUSION ::Why do people practise spirituality?</h1>
    <p>Life can be full of ups and downs, good times and bad. Many people see spirituality as a great way to seek
        comfort and peace in their life. It can often be practised alongside things like yoga, which ultimately focus on
        stress relief and release of emotion.</p>
    <p>Spirituality is a way of gaining perspective</p>
    <p>Spirituality recognises that your role in life has a greater value than what you do every day. It can relieve you
        from dependence on material things and help you to understand your life’s greater purpose. Spirituality can also
        be used as a way of coping with change or uncertainty.</p>
